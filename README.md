Nano is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized network, this makes Nano ideal for everyday transactions.we are trying to combine bitcoin with a 21 mil cap with nano to make an ultimate peer to peer cash. our idea is to give nano for every bitcoin you own, for example if you own 1 BTC you will get 1 nano for free. you dont need to exchange it. NBTC is fast, feeless, clean for the enviorment and has what people like about btc a max of 21mil.
